I suspect that the reason may be because Many documentary titles or reality shows often include a numeric element, such as rankings or competitions, and those often start with number ‘1’.\nSome other interesting fact is that there is no TV shows title that starts with the digit ‘4’ and there is no Movies title that starts with the digit ‘7’ in the US Netflix production.\n\nInsight\nThe analysis of first letters in US Netflix productions reveals some intriguing patterns:\n\nDominance of “T”: The letter “T” is the most common starting letter for titles. This is likely due to the prevalence of titles that begin with “The,” a common article in English.\nPrevalence of the Digit “1”: The digit “1” appears most frequently as the starting digit in both movies and TV shows.\nAbsence of Titles Starting with Certain Digits: There are no TV shows starting with the digit “4,” possibly indicating a lack of popular content or marketing focus. Similarly, no movies begin with “7,” which may reflect industry naming trends or a scarcity of suitable productions.\n\n\n\nReference\nThe data set Netflix_Titles comes from Kaggle w/ credit to Shivam Bansal."
